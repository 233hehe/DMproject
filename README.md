# DataMining project
## Goal: 
	Predict whether a startup will IPO by determining the contributing factors. 
## Why does it matter? 
	A common exit goal for a startup is to go public (through an IPO). Though not all startups go public (for various reasons), we seek to build a predictive model to determine if a startup, given a set of characteristics, is going to IPO or not. We hope that through this, we can elucidate potential success factors that might increase the likelihood of potential future startups reaching an IPO.
